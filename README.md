# SpringBoot-FoodAvailability-JunitTesting

A **Spring Boot** project demonstrating how to build a simple **Food Availability Management API** with **JUnit Testing**.  
This project shows best practices for writing unit and integration tests in a Spring Boot environment using **JUnit 5**, **Mockito**, and **MockMvc**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to manage food items and their availability while ensuring that every functionality is tested properly.

The application exposes REST endpoints to:
- Add a new food item
- View all food items
- Delete food items
- Check food availability by name

JUnit tests are written to verify:
- Controller logic (with `MockMvc`)
- Service logic (with `Mockito`)
- Repository behavior (if applicable)

## 🧩 Features

✅ REST APIs for CRUD operations  
✅ JUnit 5 & Mockito unit tests  
✅ Spring Boot test configuration  
✅ MockMvc for endpoint testing  
✅ Maven build automation  
✅ Clean layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
